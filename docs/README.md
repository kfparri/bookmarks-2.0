## Welcome to the bookmarks-2.0 Homepage!

Bookmarks 2.0 is a Chrome extension that is designed to allow you to quickly bookmark and close many different tabs at once and orginize them into their own folder.  This can be useful if you open a lot of tabs while doing internet research.  Especially when you have to stop and start a new research project but don't want to lose what you already have.

### Features

 -  Bookmark multiple tabs at once and save them all into a single folder in your favorites.
 - Create a custom name for the folder or simply use the default name provided ('BMK-2.0-*date*').
 - All selected tabs, once bookmarked, will be closed automatically.
