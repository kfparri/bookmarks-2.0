## Bookmarks 2.0

Bookmarks 2.0 is a new way of creating bookmarks.  If you are one of those people who have large number of tabs open all the time and need a way to quickly organize them, then this is your extension.  This extension allows you to bulk create bookmarks and orginize them into a folder.  This is particularly usefull if you open a new tab for almost every link you click and you end up researching many different things over the course of the day and have lots of "groups" of tabs open all the time.  

The extension allows you to select which tabs to bookmark and the custom folder name for the bookmarks.  Once the pages have been bookmarked, those tabs will be closed and viola!  A clean Chrome window!
